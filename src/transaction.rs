/// Different types of comparisions of Plasma Transactions.

/// Plasma Transactions form a DAG where only one pathway back to the origin is
/// considered valid. However, there may be multiple pathways, so it is important
/// to allow this behavior to be compared in order to understand which transaction
/// is legitimate.
///
/// # Note
/// This comparision is used in the history verification logic, as well as withdrawal
/// challenge detection logic. Different clients may have a privledged view of this
/// ordering, since transactions may be encrypted in some context and unencrypted in
/// others, which means relationships may differ depending on information privledge
/// of the client.

/// Plasma Cash Transaction trait for a given Token.

/// All the methods a Plasma Cash Transaction must implement to allow
/// transaction and history verification logic to work. This allows
/// custom transactions to be defined that allow significant customization
/// of the semantics of transactions while conforming to the Plasma Cash
/// specification, which creates safety in the Layer 1 â‡‹ Layer 2 bridge.
/// 
/// # Note
/// The design of this trait was such that it could be flexible enough to
/// support both transparent and encrypted transactions. When used with
/// encrypted transactions, there may be a logical difference in handling
/// transactions verification between publicly accessible information and
/// privledged parties to the transaction, so that should be taken into
/// account when using this API.
///
/// # Example
/// Users of this API should should define this e.g.
/// ```ignore
/// struct Transaction { ... }
///
/// impl PlasmaCashTxn<H256> for Transaction { ... }
/// ```
